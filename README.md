# mini-movie-app

This is a mini app for searching movies. I build this website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript during Unit-3 of Masai School. For this website I fetch the data from omdb API and showed it to the DOM. I build this website with responsiveness also with media queries.

You can run this on your local system by Live Share.
